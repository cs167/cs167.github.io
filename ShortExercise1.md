## Part 3: Introduction to Github Classroom [ 4 points ] 
I will demo this part in Day 01 and will post the recording to Blackboard. But here are the general steps:
1. Create a github account
2. Join the classroom and accept the [practice-assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/ez02Pcl5). Shoot me a Slack message if you don't see your name in the course roster.
3. Open up your shiny new Github Repository. It should look something like https://github.com/cs167/practice-assignment-your_gihub_name_here
4. Open up the `practice_assignment_starter.ipynb` file by clicking on it and then using the 'Open in Colab' button to open Google Colab.
5. Complete the exercises from `practice-assignment`: <br>
  a. Print out 'Hello World' <br>
  b. Add a text cell with some markdown components (specified in the starter code)<br>
  c. Write a function and test it <br>
  d. Import data <br>
6. Save your code to Github using File --> 'Save a Copy in Github' and select your practice-assignment repository, it should look like `your_github_name/practice-assignment`, and check the 'include a link to Colaboratory' box. 

## How to turn it in:
For ease of grading, I'm asking you to document this assignment using screenshots. Please take screenshots of:
- Intro Questionnaire submitted screen

- Your interaction with a classmate on Slack
- Your DM to me


Please include the link to your github respository in the document that you submit.

Put all of these screenshots and the link to your repository in one document and submit that document to the Assigment 0 link on Blackboard.
